# Iconography

This project standardizes on **Heroicons** as the single icon set across:

- Travel Suite mobile app (Flutter)
- Web apps in the monorepo
- Figma designs

## Figma Source

Use the community Heroicons file as the design source of truth:

- https://www.figma.com/design/8WNsSW52Z6vgJL9ZfIKF6T/Heroicons--Community-

## Flutter

The Flutter app uses the `heroicons` package and an `AppIcon` wrapper so we can keep styling consistent.
