| **Total** | | **~453** | **~263** | **~78** | **~38** | **~296** |

**Blocking pattern discovered in S2**: Many root-level API handlers (`/api/trips`, `/api/add-ons`, `/api/assistant/*`, `/api/reputation/*`, `/api/social/*`, `/api/billing/*`, `/api/settings/*`) use Supabase cookie-based session auth rather than Bearer JWT. curl-based tests with Bearer JWT cannot reach these. All such tests were marked ⏭ BLOCKED.

**S3 resolution**: Used `POST /api/auth/password-login` with `-c` flag to capture the Supabase session cookie (`sb-rtdjmykkgmirxdyfckqi-auth-token`), then replayed it with `-b` on all blocked endpoints. All Reputation, Social Studio, AI Assistant, Settings, and Nav modules are now tested. Key finding: **these modules are NOT subscription-gated** — they use cookie auth and work for any authenticated user. The 401s in S2 were auth failures, not feature gates.

|----|-----|-------------|------------|-----|--------|--------|
| BUG-001 | HIGH | `POST /api/admin/clients` → 400 "Failed to process client data" | `profiles_role_check` constraint missing `'client'` role | Migration `20260324000003` adds `'client'` to CHECK | `c5bfaa3` | Fixed |

| BUG-003 | HIGH | `/api/admin/revenue` and `/api/admin/ltv` → 500 | `payment_links` table missing (PGRST205); error thrown | Make query non-fatal; fallback to `[]` | `dca0ef3` | Fixed |
| BUG-004 | LOW | `shareUrl` contains embedded newline | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` env var has trailing newline on Vercel | `.trim()` on env var in `proposals/[id]/send/route.ts` | `0d2e774` | Fixed |
| BUG-005 | INFO | Trip `destination` null after proposal convert | QA template has no destination value | Data issue — not a code bug | — | Known Limit |
| BUG-006 | MED | `POST /api/admin/clients` with invalid JSON body → 500 | `createCatchAllHandlers` dispatcher does not handle JSON parse errors | Catch SyntaxError in dispatcher → return 400 | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-007 | LOW | `DASH-011`: `best-quote-timing` endpoint returns error via GET | Endpoint `/api/admin/insights/best-quote-timing` does not exist; test used wrong URL. The timing insight is `smart-upsell-timing`; the best-quote insight is POST-only | Test spec error — route was never registered | — | **Test Spec Error** |
| BUG-008 | MED | `/api/ai/*`, `/api/images/*`, `/api/integrations/*`, `/api/nav/counts` → 401 with valid admin JWT | These route groups use Supabase cookie-based session auth instead of Bearer JWT; inconsistent with `/api/admin/*` | Standardize auth: either use Bearer JWT for all API routes or document cookie requirement | — | **Open** |
| BUG-009 | MED | `POST /api/cron/operator-scorecards` → 401 with admin JWT | Endpoint requires either cron secret (`CRON_SECRET` or `x-vercel-cron` header) OR super_admin role — regular admin JWT rejected by design | Expected behavior — cron-only endpoint; test must use CRON_SECRET or super_admin | — | **Expected** (cron-only) |
| BUG-010 | MED | `POST /api/admin/generate-embeddings` → 500 | AI embedding provider key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or similar) not configured in Vercel | Configure embedding provider key | — | **Open** |
| BUG-011 | LOW | `GET /api/admin/geocoding/usage` → 500 | `get_geocoding_usage_stats` DB RPC function not installed; `getGeocodingUsageStats()` returned null; route returned 500 | Return 200 with `status:"not_configured"` and empty usage/limits when stats unavailable | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-012 | LOW | `?location=Goa` resolves to Genoa (Italy) not Goa (India) | Geocoder picks first match; short city names without country context are ambiguous | Require country context or bias geocoder toward travel destinations | — | **Open** |
| BUG-013 | LOW | `POST /api/admin/insights/best-quote` with nonexistent proposalId returns 200 with generated content | Endpoint fetched proposal, got null, then silently fell through to median-price fallback | Added 404 early return after `maybeSingle()` when proposalId specified but not found | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-014 | HIGH | Auth cookie `sb-...-auth-token` missing `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags | Supabase SSR client sets cookie with `SameSite=lax` only; no `HttpOnly` (JS-readable) and no `Secure` (transmits over HTTP) | Added `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to `setAll()` in `server.ts` + `middleware.ts`; `HttpOnly` omitted intentionally — `createBrowserClient` requires JS-readable cookie | 82c2b08 | **Fixed (partial)** — Secure ✅, HttpOnly ⚠️ by design |
| BUG-015 | MED | `POST /api/onboarding/setup` → 400 "Company name is required" even when `name` is in JSON body | Handler reads `body.companyName` (camelCase); QA test sent `name` (snake_case mismatch) | Accept `body.companyName ?? body.name` as alias in handler | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-016 | MED | `POST /api/social/posts` → 500 "Request failed" | Two schema mismatches: (1) `template_id` is `NOT NULL` in DB but `optional()` with no default — insert fails; (2) `hashtags` is `text` in DB but route sent `string[]` — type mismatch | Default `template_id` to `''` when absent; serialize `hashtags` array to `JSON.stringify()`; widen Zod from `.uuid()` to `.min(1)` | 82c2b08 | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-017 | MED | `GET /api/billing/subscription` → 404 "Organization not found" for authenticated QA user | `organizations` RLS SELECT policy only allows `auth.uid() = owner_id` — non-owner members get `null` silently from `maybeSingle()`; user client was used for both `organizations` and `resolveOrganizationPlan` queries | Use `createAdminClient()` for `organizations` query and `resolveOrganizationPlan()` in billing handler | 82c2b08 | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-018 | LOW | AI pricing-suggestion → "Failed to generate pricing suggestion" with valid params | OpenAI/AI provider key not configured for pricing suggestion endpoint | Configure AI provider key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or equivalent) | — | **Open** |
| BUG-019 | LOW | `GET /api/images/pixabay?query=beach` → `{url:null}` | Pixabay API key configured but response parsing returns null URL | Code uses `hits[0].webformatURL` which is correct per Pixabay API. Likely PIXABAY_API_KEY not set in Vercel or returns no results for query; handler returns `{url:null}` by design | — | **Config Issue** (graceful null is correct behavior when no results) |
| BUG-020 | LOW | `GET /api/reputation/analytics/snapshot` → 405 | Handler only exported POST (triggers snapshot generation); no GET to retrieve latest | Added GET handler that queries latest `reputation_snapshots` row for the org | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-021 | LOW | `POST /api/reputation/nps/submit` validates score before doing token DB lookup — returns 400 "score must be 1–10" when score is missing/invalid even for nonexistent tokens | Score validation happened before DB token lookup; nonexistent token + invalid score returned 400 instead of 404 | Moved score validation to after `maybeSingle()` token lookup; invalid token now always returns 404 first | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-022 | INFO | `GET /api/marketplace/{id}/view` → 405 | POST-only by design — view tracking is a side-effecting operation; GET has no defined semantics here | Test expectation wrong; use POST to record a view | — | **Expected** (POST-only) |

| BUG-025 | LOW | `OPTIONS /api/admin/*` → 405, no CORS preflight headers | Admin dispatcher tried to route OPTIONS to handler modules; none export OPTIONS → 405 | `createCatchAllHandlers` OPTIONS handler now returns 204 directly with CORS Allow headers | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-026 | MED | `GET /api/whatsapp/conversations` → 500 when WhatsApp not configured | `whatsapp-waha.server.ts` module throws `Invalid environment variables` at import time when `WPPCONNECT_*` env vars absent; entire module load fails | Inlined `sessionNameFromOrgId` logic; removed bad import; added PGRST205 graceful fallback | 6c5fb3f | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-027 | LOW | `PATCH /api/admin/clients?id={id}` — query param `id` ignored; API contract mismatch | Handler only reads `id` from request body (line 493: `body.id`); DELETE correctly reads from query param | Design inconsistency — body id is required for PATCH; `?id=` query param silently ignored | — | **Known Limitation** (by design) |
| BUG-028 | LOW | `PATCH /api/admin/clients` — email field not updatable | Comment in code: "email is not updated here to avoid auth sync issues for now" | Intentional design limitation — email update requires auth.admin.updateUserById() sync | — | **Known Limitation** (by design) |

| BUG-032 | INFO | POST /api/admin/clients returns `userId`, POST /api/admin/trips returns `tripId` — inconsistent with `id` convention | Inconsistency between handlers; downstream consumers expecting `id` key will break | No code fix — document API response keys in API reference | — | **Info/Doc** |
| BUG-033 | HIGH | POST /api/admin/trips — trip created with `endDate < startDate` (no date validation) | No date ordering check in POST handler | Added `new Date(startDate) > new Date(endDate)` → 400 check | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |

| BUG-037 | HIGH | POST /api/add-ons — negative `price` accepted and stored (e.g. `price: -10`) | No `price >= 0` validation in POST handler | Added `if (price < 0)` → 400 check in add-ons POST and PUT/PATCH | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-038 | HIGH | POST /api/add-ons — raw HTML/XSS stored verbatim in `name` field (e.g. `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) | No sanitization on `name` or `description` fields in add-ons route | Applied `sanitizeText(…, { stripHtml: true })` to name and description in POST and PUT/PATCH | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |
| BUG-039 | HIGH | GET /api/bookings/hotels/search with `checkOutDate < checkInDate` → 500 instead of 400 | No date ordering validation before sending to Amadeus API | Added `checkOutDate <= checkInDate` → 400 guard after city code resolution | pending-commit | **Fixed** ✅ |

## Infrastructure Findings (not code bugs)

| ID | Sev | Finding | Impact |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| INFO-001 | LOW | Non-existent resource IDs return 400 instead of 404 | Incorrect HTTP semantics; clients cannot distinguish bad request from not found |
| INFO-002 | LOW | Some superadmin endpoints return 404 instead of 403 for non-superadmin users | Security principle of not revealing what exists is inconsistently applied |
| INFO-003 | LOW | No request body size limit enforced (10KB+ field values accepted) | Potential DoS vector; should enforce e.g. 1MB body limit at middleware level |
| INFO-004 | MED | XSS payload chars stored in DB (client name `<script>...`) | React auto-escapes on render so not currently exploitable, but raw HTML responses or PDF generation could be affected | **Resolved** — BUG-030 fixed with `stripHtml: true` in sanitizeText |
| INFO-005 | LOW | No dedicated `GET /api/admin/tour-templates` list endpoint | Templates must be fetched via `GET /api/admin/trips?type=template` — not documented |

---

## Known Limitations (not code bugs)

- **`tour_template_days` table missing** — proposal creation from template does not auto-create `proposal_days`. Must insert manually for convert flow.
- **`payment_links` table missing** — migration `20260319000000` references `public.bookings` (also missing). Revenue/LTV degrade gracefully.
- **`RESEND_API_KEY` not set** — email delivery fails silently; all email-sending endpoints return `disabled:true`.
- **Razorpay not configured** — payment order creation disabled in Vercel env.
- **Trip PATCH endpoint missing** — `/api/admin/trips` only has GET + POST. Trip editing is UI-only.
- **Tour templates no CRUD API** — only `/api/admin/tour-templates/extract` exists; templates via PDF import only.
- **Reputation / Social / Assistant are NOT subscription-gated** — S3 confirmed all modules work for any cookie-authenticated user. The S2 "Unauthorized" was cookie auth failure, not feature gate. No superadmin action needed.
- **Social Studio write ops unblocked** — BUG-016 fixed. `POST /api/social/posts` now works. Remaining social blocks: no platform connections seeded, AI keys not configured.
- **WhatsApp WPPConnect not connected** — service is accessible (`/api/whatsapp/health` → `{connected:false}`) but no active session.
- **Flight / Hotel / Location search APIs not configured** — Amadeus or Duffel API keys missing.
- **Weather API not configured** — OpenWeatherMap key not set.
- **Pexels API works** ✅ — Images served. Pixabay returns null URL (BUG-019). Unsplash works ✅.
- **Drivers endpoint** — `/api/admin/drivers` → 404 (not in admin dispatcher). Use `/api/drivers/search?location=...` with cookie auth.
- **Google Places not configured** — INT-PLACES returns `{enabled:false, googlePlaceId:""}`.
- **TripAdvisor API key not configured** — TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY missing from Vercel env.
- **Root `/api/*` endpoints use cookie-based session auth** — resolved in S3 by capturing session cookie from login. Bearer JWT only works for `/api/admin/*`.
- **Bearer JWT expires after 1 hour** — long-running test agents that obtained a JWT at session start will get 401 on all `requireAdmin()` endpoints after expiry. Re-login before testing admin routes if session > 50 min old. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is correctly configured on Vercel (confirmed by billing fix).
