# Skills

This directory contains specialized skills imported from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills).

Each skill folder functions as a self-contained unit with:
- `SKILL.md`: Detailed instructions (Layer 1)
- `scripts/`: Python scripts and utilities (Layer 3)

These are kept separate from the main `directives/` and `execution/` folders to preserve their internal relative paths and dependencies.
